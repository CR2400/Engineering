<u><b>9/19 - 9/23</u></b>
We worked on our Rube Goldberg machine and finalized parts to make sure it worked. The first day I worked on the project I reinforced it with duct tape. I also attached rails along the sides of the cart with hotwheels under to guide it directly to the ballon. We finally tested it Friday and got it to work first try!
