<u><b>9/19 - 9/23</u></b>
We worked on our Rube Goldberg machine and finalized parts to make sure it worked. The first day I worked on the project I reinforced it with duct tape. I also attached rails along the sides of the cart with hotwheels under to guide it directly to the ballon. We finally tested it Friday and got it to work first try!

<u><b>Last 6 Weeks</b></u>
For the last 6 weeks we worked on a team project. My partner and I chose to create a car powered by a mousetrap. We had 6 weeks to complete this project to give enough time to plam it out and make multiple iterations. The first week we made a CAD of the car (which we later changed). The next couple weeks we got the materials together and started assembling the pieces of the car. We decided to change the design of the car to only having 3 wheels. We wanted to be innovative but the 3-wheeled design didn't workout how we envisioned it. The back wheel couldn't spin because the tension of the string attached to the mousetrap was slightly too much which stopped the wheel from spinning. If we could re-do this project, we would try the design with CDs instead of cardboard wheels. If that still didnt work, we would go back to the origianl 4-wheeled design. Although our car didn't perform as we wanted it to in the race, the design process was still fun and taught us some valuable lessons. Persistency is key and with practice makes perfect. We made slight changes each iteration, but not enough as we were set on the design working. I personally enjoyed the design aspects of the project and would make an awesome mousetrap car in the future.
